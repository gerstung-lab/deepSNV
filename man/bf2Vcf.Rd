\title{Function to create a \code{\link{VCF}} object with variant calls from an array of Bayes factors.}
\usage{
bf2Vcf(BF, counts, regions, samples = 1:nrow(counts), err = NULL,
  mu = NULL, cutoff = 0.05, prior = 0.5, mvcf = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{BF}{array of Bayes factors from \code{\link{bbb}}.}

\item{counts}{array of counts from \code{\link{loadAllData}}.}

\item{regions}{\code{\link{GRanges}} with the regions corresponding to counts and BF.}

\item{samples}{vector of samples names.}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff for the posterior artifact probability below which a variant is considered to be true (default = 0.05)}

\item{prior}{matrix of prior probabilities for finding a true call, typically from \code{\link{makePrior}}. Alternatively a single fixed number.}

\item{mvcf}{boolean flag, if TRUE compute a large VCF with as many genotype columns as samples. Default TRUE. Otherwise use duplicate rows and only one genotype column. The sample is then provided by the info:PD field. Can be inefficient for large sample sizes.}

\item{err}{Optional matrix of error rates, otherwise recomputed from counts.}

\item{mu}{Optional matrix of relative frequencies, otherwise recomputed from counts.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{VCF}} object
}
\description{
This function thresholds the Bayes factors computed by the shearwater algorithm and creates a \code{\link{VCF}} object as output.

Experimental code, subject to changes
