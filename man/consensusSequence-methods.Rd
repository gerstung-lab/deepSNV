\title{Calculate the consensus sequence.}
\usage{
consensusSequence(x, ...)

\S4method{consensusSequence}{matrix}(x, vector=FALSE, haploid=TRUE, het.cut = .333)

\S4method{consensusSequence}{deepSNV}(x, vector=FALSE, haploid=TRUE, het.cut = .333)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object. Either an \code{\link{deepSNV-class}} object, or a named matrix with nucleotide counts.}

\item{vector}{Boolean where TRUE indicates that a character vector should be returned.}

\item{haploid}{Should the consensus be called for a haploid control? Otherwise, also all bases larger than het.cut are rerported. Default haploid = TRUE.}

\item{het.cut}{Heterozygous cutoff. If haploid = FALSE, report all nucleotides with relative frequency larger than het.cut. Default = 0.333.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{DNAString}} with the consensus sequence, or if vector = TRUE, a character vector.
}
\description{
This function computes the consensus sequence from a matrix of nucleotide counts, or the control slot of a deepSNV object.
}
\examples{
data(HIVmix)
seq = consensusSequence(HIVmix)
consensusSequence(HIVmix, vector=TRUE)[1:10]
