Description: This package provides provides quantitative variant callers for
    detecting subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (>=100x coverage) sequencing
    experiments. The deepSNV algorithm is used for a comparative setup with a
    control experiment of the same loci and uses a beta-binomial model and a
    likelihood ratio test to discriminate sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs.
    The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a
    beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples for
    precisely estimating model parameters - such as local error rates and
    dispersion - and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation data bases such as
    COSMIC.
