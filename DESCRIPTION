Description: This package provides provides a quantitative variant callers
    for detecting subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (>=100x coverage)
    sequencing experiments. The deepSNV algorithm is used for a comparative setup 
    with a control experiment of the same loci and uses a beta-binomial model 
    and a likelihood ratio test to discriminate sequencing errors and subclonal 
    SNVs. The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a beta-
    binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples for precisely estimating
    model parameters such as local error rates and dispersion and prior knowledge, 
    e.g. from variation data bases such as COSMIC.
